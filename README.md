# Jubilare: Your Ultimate Event Partner

## Overview
Jubilare is more than just an event partnerâ€”it's your go-to platform for seamless event planning and information. From informative home pages to easy authentication and Gmail integration, Jubilare is designed to enhance your event experience.

## Five Key Features

1. **Informative Home Page:** The home page is a hub of useful information, featuring upcoming event banners and a service section where all types of services are showcased. Click the "More Info" button to dive into the details of each service category. Dynamic content is fetched from an API, providing a personalized and informative user experience. The project utilizes React Router Dom to enhance navigation.

2. **Navbar Convenience:** The navbar consolidates all essential options, including the homepage, about us, upcoming events, pricing, login, and logout. Streamlining these options in one place enhances user experience by preventing confusion and facilitating easy access to necessary information.

3. **Authentication:** Jubilare incorporates private pages accessible only to signed-in users. The logout button dynamically appears when a user is signed in, and users can seamlessly switch between the login and register pages.

4. **Login/Register with Google Mail:** For added convenience, users can create accounts or log in using Gmail. This streamlined process simplifies user interaction, and upon successful login, a modal confirms the successful operation.

5. **Utilized Technologies and Tools:**
   - [imgBB](https://imgbb.com/): Image hosting for the project.
   - [AOS Package](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): AOS is a small library for smooth scrolling animations.
   - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Firebase is used for authentication and hosting.
